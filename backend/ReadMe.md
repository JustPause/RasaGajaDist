# Architeture

So the api is trying it hardest to follow [naming](https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/), So the strucure will try to be normal

/books/ - Gives you a json list of books
/books/{books} - gives a data of the sigular book, for now it can give just chapeters json list of the book
/books/{books}/{chapeter} - gives you singular book, that chapet audio file
